= Undertow WebSocket Bridge for Apache Kafka

A demo that shows how the Undertow WebSocket API can be used to write incoming data to a Kafka topic

== Running on Openshift

Login to your Openshift cluster, or simply start a local instance using the https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/latest[oc binaries], by executing:

[source,bash]
----
oc cluster up
----

Once logged in, create a new project:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project kaftow
----

=== Adding Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka

In this project we need to add Apache Kafka and its Zookeeper, by using a _simple_ in-memory installation.
It is recommended to download https://github.com/EnMasseProject/barnabas/tree/master/kafka-inmemory/resources[these files]
and run the following:

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f zookeeper.yaml
oc create -f zookeeper-service.yaml

oc create -f kafka.yaml
oc create -f kafka-service.yaml
----

=== Deploying the Java Application

This gives you the cluster you need, and now you can deploy the Undertow server to the same project by running

[source,bash]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----


=== Testing

==== kafkacat CLI

Now that the Java app is also deployed you can use the nice https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat] tool to connect to the `websocket_bridge` of our new project:

[source,bash]
----
oc get services
----

Use the `CLUSTER-IP` of the `kafka` service, and run:

[source,bash]
----
./kafkacat -C -b CLUSTER-IP:9092 -t websocket_bridge
----

This will give you a `Connected` message that is written, once the Undertow app is fully deployed!


==== WebSocket application in the browser

In the Openshift Console open the `nip.io` Link:

This leads you a simple website, that captures mouse events from the browser, sends them to Undertow, via WebSocket.

The WebSocket connection handler than sends the data to the `websocket_bridge`.

check you `kafkacat` client to see the logs ;-)
